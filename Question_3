Question 3: Maximum product of a triplet (subsequence of size 3) in array
Problem Statement: Given an integer array, find a maximum product of a triplet in the array.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example:
Input:  arr[ ] = [10, 3, 5, 6, 20]
Output: 1200
Explanation: Multiplication of 10, 6 and 20

Input:  arr[ ] =  [-10, -3, -5, -6, -20]
Output: -90

Input: arr[ ] =  [1, -4, 3, -6, 7, 0]
Output: 168

Solution:

class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, arr):
        # code here
        first = second = third = float('-inf') 
        smallest = second_smallest = float('inf') 
        
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i]>first:
                third=second
                second=first
                first=arr[i]
            elif arr[i]>second:
                third=second
                second= arr[i]
            elif arr[i]>third:
                third=arr[i]
            
            if arr[i]<smallest:
                second_smallest=smallest
                smallest=arr[i]
            elif arr[i]<second_smallest:
                second_smallest=arr[i]
            
        return max(first*second*third,first*second_smallest*smallest)
