Question 2: Third Largest element
Problem Statement: Given an array of n integers, the task is to find the third largest element. All the elements in the array are distinct integers. 

Example:
Input: arr[] = {1, 14, 2, 16, 10, 20}
Output: 14
Explanation: Largest element is 20, second largest element is 16 and third largest element is 14

Input: arr[] = {19, -10, 20, 14, 2, 16, 10}
Output: 16
Explanation: Largest element is 20, second largest element is 19 and third largest element is 16

Solution:

class Solution:
    def thirdLargest(self,arr):
        # code here
        first = second = third = float('-inf') 
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i]>first:
                third=second
                second=first
                first=arr[i]
            elif arr[i]>second:
                third=second
                second= arr[i]
            elif arr[i]>third:
                third=arr[i]
                
        return third if third != float('-inf') else -1
