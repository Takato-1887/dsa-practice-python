Question 9: Adding one to number represented as array of digits and output as array
Problem Statement: Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits. The is to add 1 to the number (increment the number represented by the digits by 1). The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is the first element of the array.

Example:
Input : [1, 2, 4]
Output : 125
Explanation: 124 + 1 = 125 

Input : [9, 9, 9]
Output: 1000
Explanation: 999 + 1 = 1000

Solution:

class Solution:
    # Function to add one to a number represented as an array
    def addOne(self, arr):
        # code here
        # initialize an index to end of array
        index = len(arr) - 1
        
        # while the index is valid and the value
        # at index is 9
        while index >= 0 and arr[index] == 9:
            arr[index] = 0
            index -= 1
        
        # if index < 0 (if all arr were 9)
        if index < 0:
        
            # insert an one at the beginning of the list
            arr.insert(0, 1)
        
        # else increment the value at [index]
        else:
            arr[index] += 1
        
        return arr
