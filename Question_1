Question 1: Second Largest Element
Problem Statement: Given an array of positive integers arr[] of size n, the task is to find the second largest distinct element in the array.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.

Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.

Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 there is no second largest element.


Solution:

class Solution:
    def getSecondLargest(self, arr):
        # Code Here
        res=-1
        largest=0
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            if arr[i]>arr[largest]:
                res=largest
                largest=i
            
            elif arr[i]!=arr[largest]:
                if res==-1 or arr[i]>arr[res]:
                    res=i
            
        if res ==-1:
            return -1
        else:
            return arr[res]
