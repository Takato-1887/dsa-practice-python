Question 11: Finding sum of digits of a number until sum becomes single digit
Problem Statement: Given an integer n, we need to repeatedly find the sum of its digits until the result becomes a single-digit number.

Example:
Input: n = 1234 
Output: 1 
Explanation:
Step 1: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 
Step 2: 1 + 0 = 1

Input: n = 5674
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Step 1: 5 + 6 + 7 + 4 = 22 
Step 2: 2 + 2 = 4

Solution:

class Solution:
    def repeatedSumOfDigits (self,N):
        # code here 
        if N<10:
            return N
        sum=0
        while N>0:
            sum=sum+(N%10)
            N=N//10
            
        return self.repeatedSumOfDigits(sum)
