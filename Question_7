Question 7: Wave Array
Problem Statement: Sort an array in wave form

Example:
Given a sorted array arr[] of integers (in ascending order), rearrange the elements in-place to form a wave-like array.
An array is said to be in wave form if it satisfies the following pattern: arr[0] ≥ arr[1] ≤ arr[2] ≥ arr[3] ≤ arr[4] ≥ ...
In other words, every even-indexed element should be greater than or equal to its adjacent odd-indexed elements (if they exist).

Solution:

class Solution:
    def sortInWave(self, arr):
        # code here
        for i in range(1,len(arr)-1,2):
            arr[i],arr[i-1]=arr[i-1],arr[i]
    	 return arr
