Question 6: Rotate an Array by d - Counterclockwise or Left
Problem Statement: Given an array of integers arr[] of size n, the task is to rotate the array elements to the left by d positions.

Example:
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, d = 2
Output: {3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2}
Explanation: After first left rotation, arr[] becomes {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1} and after the second rotation, arr[] becomes {3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2}

Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3}, d = 4
Output: {2, 3, 1}
Explanation: The array is rotated as follows:

After first left rotation, arr[] = {2, 3, 1}
After second left rotation, arr[] = {3, 1, 2}
After third left rotation, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
After fourth left rotation, arr[] = {2, 3, 1}

Solution:

class Solution:
    #Function to rotate an array by d elements in counter-clockwise direction. 
    def rotateArr(self, arr, d):
        #Your code here
        n=len(arr)
        d = d % n
        reverse(arr,0,d-1)
        reverse(arr,d,n-1)
        reverse(arr,0,n-1)
    
def reverse(arr, start, end):
    while start<end:
        arr[start],arr[end]=arr[end],arr[start]
        start+=1
        end-=1
